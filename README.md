## Assignments

You will be building a simple command line Hangman game where one player plays against the computer, but a bit more advanced. If youâ€™re unfamiliar with how Hangman works, see [Wikipedia](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)>).

Main objective of this project is to use serialization and deserialization.
